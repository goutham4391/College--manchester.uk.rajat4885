The event is happening at a time of intensification of Russia’s unprovoked aggression against Ukraine, recently targeting civilian infrastructure with indiscriminate bombing.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>The Ukrainian Student Conference is organised by the Ukrainian Student Union (UK), the Ukraine Hub UK initiative (set up by The University of Manchester's MOBILISE Project UK team following the February 24 all-out Russian invasion), and most importantly, the Ukrainian Student Societies of the Universities of Manchester, Oxford and LSE.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>The main coordinating team included Jan Szkulepa, Makar Mizevych, Ruslan Pavlyshyn, Maliek Banat, Danylo Nikiforov, among many other students part of the three societies (including a large team at UoM).&nbsp;Ms Cressida Arkrwright a UoM PhD expert on Ukrainain Youth Engagement supported the event as PhD Coordinator and our resident Ukrainian Politics expert Dr. Olga Onuch acted as senior mentor.</span></p><p>The event is generously funded by the University of Manchester's <span style="background-color:white;"><span>Humanities Strategic Civic Engagement Fund (HSCEF), and is also supported by the MOBILISE project and Ukrainian Embassy in the UK.</span></span><br><br><span>This conference brings together dozens of Ukrainian students and UK University alumni from across the whole country for a day of talks, working groups, monitoring, and lectures. Among many special guests will be Ms. Olga Tokariuk,&nbsp;a renowned Ukrainian Journalist and&nbsp;Reuters Institute Fellow at Oxford, and Professor Andrew Wilson of UCL will be joining the students for key note lectures.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>Dr Onuch said “It is our duty as scholars and university leaders to support the next generation - one way we can do this is to &nbsp;provide a space where they can come together, meet each other, and feel a collective sense of support and meaning," said Dr Onuch. “These students have been through unthinkable trauma and stress in the last year - they have family and friends in harm's way, and yet they still have to write essays, sit exams, and think of finding a job. Thus, we must do all we can to support them and their ambitions.”</span><br><br>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

Recent activity such as the Home Office’s ‘This is Abuse’ social marketing campaign, Police Scotland’s ‘Don’t be that Guy’ campaign, and Greater Manchester’s ‘Is this Okay?’ campaign were all influenced by findings about the importance of social marketing campaigns in creating behaviour change among men.&nbsp;<br><br>The research findings also contributed to GMCA’s 10-year strategy to tackle gender-based violence, and the toolkit generated by the project has influenced school-based preventative strategies as well as being rolled out in Malta, France and Spain.&nbsp;</p><p>“Perhaps the most important thing our research established is that it is pointless simply telling young men that domestic abuse is ‘wrong’ – most already know that. Rather, public education campaigns must engage with young men on their own terms around issues of trust, vulnerability and control over the long term if they are to secure sustained reductions in the rates of men’s violence against women and girls.," added Professor Gadd.<br><br>“David’s work has been ground-breaking,” said Suzanne Jacob, CEO of SafeLives, a UK-wide domestic abuse charity. “It gives a sense of how we can bring boys and men into the work to end the abuse of girls and women, and help overcome some of the challenges we all face in achieving truly transformational change.”&nbsp;<br><br>“Government as well as other agencies and organisations all strive to provide young people who use violence with opportunities for change - Professor David Gadd’s work illuminates how to make this a reality and reduce domestic abuse in society,” said Nicole Jacobs, Domestic Abuse Commissioner for England and Wales.&nbsp;<br><br>The winners of the prize will be announced at an awards ceremony on 2nd November 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>For more information on Professor Gadd’s work and the ‘From Boys to Men’ project, visit <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/david.gadd.html" target="_blank">https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/david.gadd.html &nbsp;</a><br><br>For more information about the ESRC Celebrating Impact Prize and how to livestream the awards ceremony, visit <a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/esrc-celebrating-impact-prize" target="_blank">https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/esrc-celebrating-impact-prize/. &nbsp;</a></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

Significant progress has already been made in identifying the priority areas – education and skills, and jobs and growth.</p><p>The Greater Manchester university vice-chancellors and principal said: “Greater Manchester’s universities are one of our region’s greatest strengths and while we have always recognised our individual impact, together we know that we can do more.</p><p>“Whether it’s working with our further education colleges to expand training and skills development opportunities or collaborating with the private sector to drive inward investment into innovation in Greater Manchester, by coming together as a collective we can be more than the sum of our parts.</p><p>“Celebrating the first year of the Civic University Agreement allows to us to reflect on what we’ve achieved so far as well as look to the future and set ourselves bold ambitions for helping to make Greater Manchester the best place to grow up, get on and grow old.”</p><p>Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester, said: “Greater Manchester is proud to be home to world-leading universities that make an enormous contribution to our region. The Civic University Agreement recognises the essential role they have as anchor institutions, while setting out their responsibilities to our city-region beyond teaching and research.</p><p>“One year on from signing this landmark agreement, we’re beginning to see the benefits that closer collaboration can bring. Our universities will continue to carry out ground-breaking research, provide people with valuable skills and foster innovation and entrepreneurship, while also ensuring this contribution benefits everyone in Greater Manchester.”</p><p>Cllr Bev Craig, Leader of Manchester City Council and GMCA Portfolio Lead for Economy, Business and International, said: “Greater Manchester’s universities play a fundamental role in our society and economy. Their teaching and research attracts tens of thousands of people to our city-region each year, and universities also support businesses, spark economic growth and play an important role in communities.</p><p>“The Civic University Agreement formally sets out the priorities we share and the contribution universities can make as we seek to create a fairer, greener and more prosperous city-region. With this agreement now established, we look forward to strengthening our collaboration and realising the collective potential we have to make a positive impact.</p><p>“Through their support for initiatives like Innovation Greater Manchester and Open SME, and becoming Living Wage Employers, universities are helping us shape the city-region’s economy so it delivers the right kind of growth.”</p><p>The institutions are closely involved in the development of Innovation Greater Manchester – the business-led partnership which brings together the private sector, local and national governments, and the universities to drive the growth of the city-region’s innovation ecosystem. The Government subsequently made a commitment to establish Innovation Accelerators, including one centred on Greater Manchester and Innovation Greater Manchester, in the Levelling Up White Paper.</p><p>And Open SME demonstrates this collaborative commitment to working together to drive inclusive growth in the city region. This programme, that brings together Greater Manchester’s business schools, the Combined Authority and the Business Growth Hub, is an online support programme designed to support small and medium sized firms in the city region to develop and grow.</p><p>All five higher education institutions in the city region are now Real Living Wage employers, paving the way for them to become supporters and members of the Greater Manchester Good Employment Charter, which was another pledge in the Civic University Agreement.</p><p>The Civic University Agreement itself was developed in direct response from feedback from residents of Greater Manchester and to mark the one-year anniversary of the agreement, a new Civic University Citizens Panel has been launched to provide a forum for civic engagement between the universities and members of the public across the city region.</p><p><span>People from across Greater Manchester, but with a strong focus on those from underrepresented groups, will be invited to be part of the panel where they will directly feed into the work of the universities on their civic priorities.&nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The successful implementation of the new Vertex Locator (VELO), which was partly built in Manchester offers a greater collision rate of protons and efficiency.</span></p><p><span>The process is called “VELO closing” in the LHCb jargon. The LHC has recently started its third running period after a three-year long shutdown. In this period, one of the four major experiments, LHCb, has been upgraded with new detectors and a new readout system to be able to operate with a five times greater collision rate and with improved data selection efficiency. The experiment, which is lead by Professor Chris Parkes of The University of Manchester, has reached a major milestone today.</span></p><p><span>The LHC accelerates two beams of protons to nearly the speed of light and brings these beams, which travel around the 27 km circumference ring in opposite directions, to collide at four points. These four collision points are surrounded by detectors that probe the interactions of fundamental particles, which are produced in the proton-proton collisions. The heart of the LHCb detector is called the Vertex Locator and most of its detector modules were </span><a href="https://www.mub.eps.manchester.ac.uk/science-engineering/2022/10/11/building-equipment-for-the-large-hadron-collider/"><span>built at The University of Manchester</span></a><span>.</span></p><p><span>The LHCb Vertex Locator modules can approach the LHC beams to as close as 5 mm, but they are retracted by about 3 cm to protect them during the period of beam injection and acceleration when the beams are less stable. Today, they have been brought to their fully closed position for the first time.</span></p><p><span>Professor Chris Parkes said: "The closing of the new LHCb Vertex Locator is a milestone for the upgraded experiment. Once closed, the LHC beams with an energy of the Eurostar train pass through an aperture the width of a pencil. The proximity of the sensors to the LHC beam will allow a precision imaging of the LHC collisions.”</span></p><p><span>The production of the Vertex Locator module was a major part of the £15m construction project in the UK, which was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council and which was led by Professor Parkes. Starting with first discussions in 2007, the R&D for the upgraded LHCb experiment ramped up a decade ago and moved to the construction phase in the last few years.</span></p><p><span>The production of the Vertex Locator module was a major part of the £15m construction project in the UK, which was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council and which was led by Professor Parkes. Starting with first discussions in 2007, the R&D for the upgraded LHCb experiment ramped up a decade ago and moved to the construction phase in the last few years.</span></p><p><span>The University of Manchester produced about 80% of the Vertex Locator modules in the cleanrooms of the Particle Physics Group in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. On the way to delivering these modules, the team of physicists, engineers, technicians and students overcame many challenges from adhesives not behaving as expected to the lab closure during the first COVID-19 lockdown.</span></p><p><span>Building every module started with taking delivery of the components and gluing the support legs to the half-millimetre thick silicon substrate, which acts as the main carrier plate for the remaining components and which provides cooling. This silicon plate contains microscopic channels etched into its inside through which liquid CO2 is pumped to absorb the heat produced by the sensors and readout electronics. The pre-fabricated silicon pixel sensors, which are connected to readout chips to form rectangular elements of 6 cm<sup>2</sup> size, were glued with micrometer precision onto the substrate alongside the front-end readout circuitry. Electrical connections were established with hundreds of tiny wire bonds and after all power supply and data readout cables were attached, the modules’ functionality is fully tested in a vacuum, resembling their final operational conditions at the LHC.</span></p><p><span>These modules required highly customised assembly tools and procedures and a bespoke test stand. The project was underpinned by the collaboration of engineers and physicists who devised the materials and processes to satisfy the operational requirement of the detectors, which are now operated in a high vacuum and which record the position of charged particles that traverse with a precision of about ten micrometres. The amount of particle collisions also require all components to be able to tolerate the radiation dose they will be exposed to over its lifetime.</span></p><p><span>Professor Marco Gersabeck, who leads the LHCb team at The University of Manchester, said:</span></p><p><span>“This first full operation is the finishing touch to a decade-long R&D a constructing project in which our team of physicists, engineers, technicians and students combined their skills and expertise to design and build most of the high-precision detector modules that make up the VELO detector.”</span></p><p><span>At CERN, other team members are involved on the frontline of VELO operations. They calibrate the position of the individual sensors on all VELO modules to micrometer&nbsp;precision and monitor the quality of the acquired data live. Over the coming years, they will determine how radiation affects the detector performance.&nbsp;The detector is designed to operate for the coming ten years, during which time the LHCb dataset is expected to increase by about a factor of six. The LHCb experiment, which is dedicated to the precision study of particles containing quarks, has over the past decade made landmark discoveries including </span><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/manchester-scientists-contribute-to-antimatter-discovery-at-cern/"><span>new sources of matter-antimatter asymmetries</span></a><span> and new particle states such as </span><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/large-hadron-collider-project-discovers-three-new-exotic-particles/"><span>Pentaquarks</span></a><span>. Over the lifetime of the new VELO modules, they will facilitate measurements with an unprecedented precision by recording 30 million collisions a second.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The University of Manchester team is now shifting focus to </span><a href="https://www.staffnet.manchester.ac.uk/news/archive/list/display/?id=16253&year=2016&month=04"><span>preparations for the successor of the new detector</span></a><span>.

However, university is a more common route for his generation to take, so he was able to realise that he had the option to continue studying – a decision that his parents would never have decided to take.</span><br><br><span>“From my family education trajectory, I am embedded in a very different context of opportunity structure from my parents,” said Kaidong. “This has shaped our very different views of educational paths, and it inspired me to explore the inter-generational experience and perception of working-class students from different generations.”</span><br><br><span>In his research, which has been published in the </span><a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01425692.2022.2109592"><span>British Journal of Sociology of Education</span></a><span>, he spoke to people from working-class backgrounds of various ages who either attended comprehensive schools or grammar schools before 1988, or who attended school after the Education Act 1988.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>He found that subjective rationality - assessing whether university was an achievable objective - was key to the choices people made, and that they only made the decision to go to university if they developed a ‘sense of the possible and achievable’ when they were at school.</span><br><br><span>Those who were at school pre-1988 were more likely to go to university if they went to a grammar school – this is because attending university was seen as typical route or even expected by their teachers and peers, and this ethos made them perceive it as the normal next step in life. By contrast, many of those who went to comprehensives left at 15 or 16 because university was not seen as the norm, which meant they were never able to realise it could be a possibility for them.</span><br><br><span>Those at school post-1988 had a very different experience, as the significant expansion of higher education saw all young people from disadvantaged backgrounds encouraged to follow this path for the first time. Their experience of comprehensive schooling led them to see university as a ‘realistic’ destination – they cite the encouragement of teachers and more information provided about university as being the main difference in their experience when compared to those who attended similar schools pre-1988.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

A majority of respondents had witnessed one or more judges acting in a racially biased way towards a defendant and in their decision-making. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Racial discrimination by judges is most frequently directed towards Asian and Black people according to the survey, with people from Black communities - lawyers, witnesses, defendants, etc. - by far the most common targets of judicial discrimination. Young Black male defendants were the subgroup most frequently mentioned as targets of judicial bias. &nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">The survey did find that some judges are already acting in ‘antiracist’ ways by being conscious of and knowledgeable about racism, and seeking to mitigate it - however, only a minority of respondents had ever seen a judge act in this way.</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Race training is neither compulsory nor provided on a regular basis – only 49% of the respondents who have worked as judicial office holders had received race training in the preceding three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">The report emerges as serious questions are already being asked about the treatment of ethnic minority people in the justice system. Black barristers are </span><a href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/discrimination-is-keeping-uk-bench-white-say-judges-88hv8db0r" target="_blank"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>underrepresented</u></span></a><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"> and report experiencing </span><a href="https://www.legalfutures.co.uk/latest-news/judges-most-likely-to-discriminate-against-black-barristers" target="_blank"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>racism from judges, magistrates and panel members</u></span></a><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">. On top of this, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/643001/lammy-review-final-report.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>The Lammy Review</u></span></a><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.barcouncil.org.uk/uploads/assets/d821c952-ec38-41b2-a41ebeea362b28e5/Race-at-the-Bar-Report-2021.pdf" target="_blank"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>Race at the Bar report</u></span></a><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"> found that sentencing outcomes are often harsher for ethnic minority defendants. &nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Overall, the report suggests that the combination of quantitative and qualitative data presented, substantiated by the kind of reports listed above, amounts to evidence of ‘institutional racism’ in the justice system presided over by judges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">The report is a response to the five-year strategy launched by Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett of Maldon to enhance equality and diversity in the judiciary, and finds that it does not consider the issue of racism or even mention ‘racial bias’. Researchers found a profound disparity between the conclusions of the strategy - that the justice system is basically fair and that progress has been made - when compared to the widespread views and experiences of the legal professionals surveyed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">In addition, the report is critical of the </span><i><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">Equal Treatment Bench Book</span></i><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">, the textbook given to all judges on appointment, in terms of its framing of bias and racism, especially its lack of acknowledgement of anti-Black racism in the justice system. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">The evidence in the report rings alarm bells about access to fair trials, hearings and tribunals as well as to equal professional development. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">“Racism in the justice system has to be acknowledged and fought by those at the highest level, but at the moment there is complete and utter silence - and as a consequence, there is no action to combat racial bias,” said Keir Monteith KC. “It is impossible to have diversity and inclusion if the system itself unfairly discriminates. There has to be a hard reboot to protect and revitalize the rule of law and civil rights for all citizens - a good start would be to follow the recommendations in our report.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><br><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;">“Judges need to sit up and listen, because it is a myth that Lady Justice is blind to colour,” said Professor Leslie Thomas KC, who wrote the report’s Foreword. “Our judiciary as an institution is just as racist as our police forces, our education system and our health service - this is something that cannot be ignored for any longer.”</span></p><p style="margin-left:0px;"><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">“This important report demonstrates that the very low number of Black and minority ethnic judges poses an acute challenge to the credibility and legitimacy of the judiciary,” said Stephanie Needleman from </span></span><a href="https://justice.org.uk/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>JUSTICE</u></span></span></a><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">. “It is only by creating a critical mass of diverse judges that we can ensure that our judiciary is reflective of society and begin to combat the racism witnessed by survey respondents.”</span></span><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br><br><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">“We welcome, and are grateful to have been consulted on, this hard-hitting report,” said former Judge Claire Gilham from the </span></span><a href="https://judicialsupportnetwork.org/" target="_blank"><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;"><u>Judicial Support Network.</u></span></span></a><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;"> “My whistleblowing about racism was dismissed as me not understanding judicial culture, having come from the wrong background. There is no internal data keeping for equality complaints, which makes it very difficult for the judiciary to provide any evidence to deny the findings of this report. A severe shake-up of the system is needed.”</span></span><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><br><br><span style="background-color:transparent;"><span style="margin:0px;padding:0px;text-align:left;">“Even after 25 years as a Trade Union Official, I am shocked at the practices employed in the appointment and promotion of judges,” said Stuart Fegan from GMB. “The Judiciary is funded with public money, and the practices identified would simply not be tolerated anywhere else in the public sector. I am delighted that Labour have committed to review appointment and promotion procedures if they win the next election in order to ensure that judges are reflective of the public they serve.”</span></span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

One of the two telescope receivers will be assembled and tested at the University, while one of the SO:UK telescope mounts will be installed at Jodrell Bank Observatory. Both of the receivers will in turn be installed on the mount at Jodrell Bank for full system verification tests before being shipped to the observing site in Chile. In addition, The University of Manchester will host the SO:UK data centre and will play a major role in the pipeline development work.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>SO is a ground-based telescope on a mountain 5200m (17,000 feet) above the Atacama Desert in Chile. Prior to the new UK contribution, SO was comprised of a single large aperture telescope and three small aperture telescopes.&nbsp;<span> </span>Together, they will make precise and detailed observations of the CMB, the heat left over from the hot, early days of the history of the Universe.</p><p>Tiny fluctuations in the CMB radiation tell us about fluctuations in how matter was distributed shortly after the Big Bang, which are the initial seeds of all structure in the Universe. Studying the CMB gives clues about both the origin of structure, and how the initial matter fluctuations have grown over time to form the structure of the Universe we know now.</p><p>Observations with SO promise to provide these breakthrough discoveries that will help us understand how the Big Bang led to the formation of stars and galaxies.</p><p>The two types of telescope on SO will do two different jobs. The small aperture telescopes are focussed on searching for signatures of primordial gravitational waves. If detected, this signal would open a unique observational window on physics at very early times, and at ultra-high energies.</p><p><span>The large aperture telescope will address a range of unsolved questions including the nature of neutrinos and other relativistic species, the nature of dark matter, and the physics giving rise to the observed accelerated expansion of the Universe.</span></p><p>The international project is led by the US, supported by the Simons Foundation and the Heising-Simons Foundation, and includes 85 institutes from 13 countries.</p><p><span>Starting this month, the six universities delivering the major new UK contribution are:</span></p><ul><li><span>Cambridge&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Cardiff&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Imperial College London&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Manchester</span></li><li><span>Oxford&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sussex</span></li></ul><p><span>With £18 million funding from UK Research and Innovation, </span><a href="https://www.ukri.org/what-we-offer/creating-world-class-research-and-innovation-infrastructure/"><span>through the UKRI Infrastructure Fund</span></a><span>, the UK will be leading on </span>two additional telescopes providing a major increase in the sensitivity of the facility, along with UK expertise in data processing and analysis.</p><p><span>The UK lead, Professor Michael Brown, of The University of Manchester, said: “SO is poised to become the leading CMB project of the 2020s. It will address some of the most profound questions in all of science. With this major new funding, UK scientists will continue to play a world-leading role at the forefront of this high-profile science area.”</span></p><p><span>Dr Colin Vincent, Associate Director for Astronomy at STFC, said: “This major investment by UKRI will allow UK researchers to spearhead discoveries alongside partners in this international facility, uncovering the secrets from the very dawn of time.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The centres, part of NIHR’s research infrastructure, receive substantial levels of sustained funding to attract the best scientists and create an environment where experimental medicine can thrive, while also providing opportunities for a diverse range of professionals to undertake research, expanding research expertise.</span></p><p><span>Formed in 2017 with a £28.5 million five-year award from the NIHR, Manchester BRC is the largest BRC outside the South East of England </span><span style="background-color:white;">and brings together world-leading academic clinical researchers. Manchester BRC is hosted by </span><a href="https://mft.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;">Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust (MFT)</span></a><span style="background-color:white;"> and </span><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;">The University of Manchester (UoM)</span></a><span style="background-color:white;">, in partnership with </span><a href="https://www.christie.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;">The Christie NHS Foundation Trust</span></a><span style="background-color:white;"> and the </span><a href="https://www.northerncarealliance.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;">Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust</span></a><span style="background-color:white;">. With this new 2022-27 award, Manchester BRC will increase research capacity by expanding our partnership to include three new NHS trusts; </span><a href="https://www.gmmh.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;"><span>Greater Manchester Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust,</span></span></a><span style="background-color:white;"><span> </span></span><a href="https://www.lancsteachinghospitals.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;"><span>Lancashire Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</span></span></a><span style="background-color:white;"><span>, and </span></span><a href="https://www.bfwh.nhs.uk/"><span style="background-color:white;"><span>Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust</span></span></a><span style="background-color:white;">. The new funding also allows Manchester BRC to expand from our current research areas of cancer, dermatology, hearing health, musculoskeletal, and respiratory, into further areas of relevance to our diverse populations including heart disease, mental health, and rare conditions.</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;"><strong>Professor Ian Bruce, Director of NIHR Manchester BRC</strong>, said: “We are absolutely delighted to receive this award from the NIHR – which more than doubles our previous award. This is a testament to our achievements over the past five years and also to our vision for the future; expanding both our research themes and our geographical reach. This will ensure that c</span><span>ommunities across our region’s urban, rural and coastal settings will now be able to participate in cutting-edge research. This award also allows us to further build our workforce to develop and deliver research across our region and to involve many more of our citizens and local patients in our research planning.</span></p><p><span>“We know that our region has high levels of deprivation and was disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which further widened health inequity. It is therefore imperative that Manchester BRC continues to bridge the gaps between new discoveries and personalised care, to ensure that we are levelling up health and care for all.</span></p><p><span>“I would like to thank everyone involved with our bid over the last two years. It has taken a monumental effort of hard work and dedication from our BRC Faculty and Core Team, and our partners, who were all singularly driven in our vision to drive health improvements and lasting change for all.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;"><strong>Davine Forde,</strong> from Moss Side, is an Associate at the Manchester BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) Network CIC, and the Patient Involvement Representative for the Manchester BRC Governance Board. She said: “Manchester has some of the poorest health outcomes in the country, especially in ethnic minority communities. I want to be part of the solution to fixing this, and I’m delighted to be working with Manchester BRC who share that vision.</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;">“Manchester BRC doesn’t just talk about equality – it lives it, by giving value to the lived experience of our diverse population and communities. We are not just patients, but partners on par with academics and clinicians to help overcome these problems. We can all learn from each other, and Manchester BRC’s commitment to inclusivity means we are on the road to discovery together.</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;">“As an individual living with several long-term conditions, we may not find the treatments for my conditions, but the legacy of Manchester BRC will be improving health outcomes and reducing health inequalities for my children, and grandchildren.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;"><strong>Sir Michael Deegan CBE, Group Chief Executive of MFT</strong>, said: “Clinical research and innovation are key to Greater Manchester’s reputation as a world-class healthcare setting. We are very proud to host one of the largest NIHR portfolios in the country as part of our ‘One Manchester’ vision, and the new expanded Manchester BRC will help us to deliver even more cutting-edge treatments to our patients in Greater Manchester, and beyond.”</span></p><p><span><strong>President and Vice-Chancellor of The University of Manchester, Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell,</strong> said: “This announcement is another example of the strength and depth of Greater Manchester’s provision as a world leading centre for biomedical and health research.</span></p><p><span>“This funding will further enhance the rightly deserved reputation for the city-region and contribute to improving the health outcomes and inequalities for our residents, and many more people beyond. As a University, we are extremely proud of the work we have done over the past five years as a fundamental part of the BRC collaboration and very much look forward to working with our partners in the future.”</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;"><strong>Professor Graham Lord, Vice-President and Dean of The University of Manchester’s Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health</strong>, said: “Over the last five years we have been able to demonstrate that our clinical academic research not only provides excellence, but also value for money. Through our leveraged grant income, output of highly citated papers, and strategic collaborations with key industry partners, we have established Manchester BRC as a powerhouse of translational research.</span></p><p><span style="background-color:white;">“When we look back on this award, we will see it as critical upward turn for our entire ecosystem”</span></p><p><span><strong>Andy Burnham, Mayor of Greater Manchester</strong>, said: “Greater Manchester is big enough to matter, but small enough to know each other and driven enough to make a difference. Manchester BRC encapsulates this perfectly. Bringing together our brilliant clinical and academic minds to collaborate on the healthcare challenges our region faces, driving those discoveries through into treatments, and sharing them with the rest of the world.</span></p><p><span>“This is a truly exciting time for everyone in Greater Manchester, and Manchester BRC is pivotal to creating a better future for all of us.”</span></p><p><span><strong>Paul Dennet, Salford City Mayor and Greater Manchester Integrated Care Partnership Chair,</strong> said: “Integrated care means starting with the person, understanding they’ll have different needs as they move through life, and connecting them with the right care. Manchester BRC’s mission is to bring new discoveries into individualised, personalised care, and I’m delighted this funding will allow for new research and treatments, improving the health, wealth and wellbeing of the 2.8 million people living in Greater Manchester”.</span></p><p><span><strong>Sir Richard Leese, Chair, NHS Greater Manchester Integrated Care (IC)</strong>, said: “Manchester BRC’s award is a major boost to our research capabilities in the Integrated Care system and it provides us with a clear line of sight to help us deal with many of the major health and care needs of our city-region. It will also help us reduce many of the health inequalities that are evident in our diverse population.”</span></p><p><span>BRCs have supported almost 60,000 studies and published 55,000 research papers, as well as supported the career development of more than 14,000 junior doctors and research scientists.</span></p><p><span><strong>Professor Lucy Chappell, Chief Executive of the NIHR</strong>, said:&nbsp;“Research by NIHR Biomedical Research Centres has led to a number of ground-breaking new treatments, such as new gene therapies for haemophilia and motor neurone disease,&nbsp;the world-first treatment for Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, a nose-drop vaccine for whooping cough, and the first UK-wide study into the long-term impact of COVID-19.</span></p><p><span>“This latest round of funding recognises the strength of expertise underpinning health and care research across the country and gives our nation’s best researchers more opportunities to develop innovative new treatments for patients.”</span></p><p><span style="padding:0cm;">Read more about the 2022 BRC funding announcement via&nbsp;the </span><a href="https://www.nihr.ac.uk/about-us/news/"><span style="padding:0cm;">NIHR website</span></a><span style="padding:0cm;">.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

However, the data imply that prejudice against minorities has led to unequal rates of court appearances and custody for non-white young adults.</span><br><br><span>This concise study presents tantalizing opportunities for further exploration of the factors behind the changes. It is therefore worth rehearsing the main points in some detail before reflecting on their significance.</span><br><br><span><strong>A decade of data</strong></span><br><br><span>In England and Wales, the rate of court appearances among young adults (aged 18–24) fell by three quarters, from 32 court appearances per thousand young adults in 2007–08 to 8 per thousand in 2018–19. This reduction predates the impact of court closures due to COVID restrictions. It also exceeded the decline in court appearances for older age groups. The custody rate in general for young adults has also declined but remains relatively high -twice as high as for those over 24. The drops have occurred across a range of offences, including theft, burglary, violent and sexual offences, and criminal damage. Significantly the proportion of appearances for drug-related offences has increased.</span><br><br><span>The broad trends are echoed in figures published by the </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956621/youth-justice-statistics-2019-2020.pdf"><span>Youth Justice Board</span></a><span>, which reports that the number of occasions when young adults (aged 18-20) were sentenced decreased by 58 per cent between 2010 and 2020; however, the Board’s figures do not take account of a significant fluctuation in population, which the current study usefully addresses.</span><br><br><span>The data in the new study also indicate different - and harsher - treatment of minorities by police and courts. By 2017–18, the rate for ‘white’ young adults had fallen to 11 court appearances per thousand – a reduction of 63 per cent. However, the rate among ‘non-white’ young adults stood at 22 court appearances per thousand – a reduction of 46 per cent but still much higher than for ‘white’ young adults. Custody rates also differed: the rate of immediate custody for ‘white’ young adults declined by 62 per cent, whereas for ‘non-white’ young adults it fell by 53 per cent.</span><br><br><span><strong>Possible factors</strong></span><br><br><span>The scope of the changes indicate that something important has been going on - but what? For some, it might be tempting to speculate about a new generational morality, but according to the researchers, crime has not fallen proportionally. The likelier explanations are institutional.</span><br><br><span>In assessing general contextual factors, it will be worth looking at the impact of court closures, and a reduction in police numbers. In particular, when annual recorded crimes are considered, the rates of charging/ summons have </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/crime-outcomes-in-england-and-wales-2021-to-2022/crime-outcomes-in-england-and-wales-2021-to-2022"><span>declined substantially</span></a><span> over the last seven years. Moreover, the study shows significant geographical differences. The Metropolitan Police area showed relatively less decline, leading to it having the highest current rate of court appearances by young adults.</span><br><br><span>To shed more light on the key generational difference, the authors’ hunch is to explore the long-term effects of earlier criminal justice processing on young adult outcomes.</span><br><br><span>Here we should examine, first of all, what has happened to the recent cohorts which have experienced a systematic fall in interventions and a rise in diversionary practices. Long term reductions in the numbers of first time entrants to criminal justice have been dramatic: the rate per 100,000 of the 10–17 year-old population was 1,929 in the 12 months to the end of June 2007 and 484 to the end of June 2013. The introduction of Community Resolutions and triage systems may have played some part in these trends. However, ominously, the proportion of first time entrants who were categorised as ‘black’ </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/653182/trends-in-fte-to-the-youth-justice-system.pdf"><span>rose over the same period</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>Steady declines in sanctions have occurred over the recent decade, and in the year ending March 2020, </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/956621/youth-justice-statistics-2019-2020.pdf"><span>82 per cent fewer children received a caution or sentence than in the year ending March 2010</span></a><span>.</span><br><br><span>In broad terms, the historical patterns of first time entrants and sanctions form a plausible starting point for understanding the changes in court appearances observed among young adults.</span><br><br><span><strong>Discrimination</strong></span><br><br><span>A crucial element in the apparent prejudice directed at ‘non-white’ young men is likely to be broad-brush attributions – open or tacit - of dangerousness. </span><a href="https://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/publications/usual-suspects"><span>Our study of homicide prosecutions</span></a><span> also confirmed the enduring salience of group prosecutions brought against young black men.</span><br><br><span>The rhetoric of ‘gangs’ casts a wide net of association, inflating the seriousness of any charge or court appearance.

The researchers found that water breaks exponentially faster in response to stronger electrical forces.</span></p><p><span><img class="image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:200px;" src="https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1369/500_marcelo.jpg?x=1665069901723" alt="Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo">The researchers believe that this fundamental understanding of interfacial water could be used to design better catalysts to generate hydrogen fuel from water. This is an important part of the UK’s strategy towards achieving a net zero economy. Dr Marcelo Lozada-Hidalgo said: “We hope that the insights from this work will be of use to various communities, including physics, catalysis, and interfacial science and that it can help design better catalysts for green hydrogen production”.</span></p><p><span>A water molecule consists of a proton and a hydroxide ion. Dissociating it involves pulling these two constituent ions apart with an electrical force. In principle, the stronger one pulls the water molecule apart, the faster it should break. This important point has not been demonstrated quantitatively in experiments.</span></p><p><span>Electrical forces are well known to break water molecules, but stronger forces do not always lead to faster water dissociation, which has puzzled scientists for a long time. A key difference with graphene electrodes is that these are permeable only to protons. The researchers found that this allows separating the resulting proton from the hydroxide ion across graphene, which is a one-atom-thick barrier that prevents their recombination. This charge separation is essential to observe the electric field acceleration of water dissociation. Another key advantage of graphene is that it allows evaluating the electric field at the graphene-water interface experimentally, which allows for quantitative characterisation of the field effect.</span></p><p><span><img class="image_resized image-style-align-left" style="width:200px;" src="https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1369/500_junhao.jpg?x=1665060352495" alt="Junhao Cai">The results can be explained using the classical Onsager theory, which had remained unverified experimentally in the important case of water. Junhao Cai, a PhD student and co-first author of the work said: “We were surprised to find how well the Onsager theory fitted our data. This theory provides insights into interfacial water, including an independent estimate of its dielectric constant, which remains poorly understood”.</span></p><p><span><img class="image_resized image-style-align-right" style="width:200px;" src="https://presspage-production-content.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/1369/500_eoin.jpg?x=1665062910397" alt="Eoin Griffin">The authors are excited about the possibilities offered by their experimental setup. Eoin Griffin, PhD student and co-first author of the work said: “Graphene electrodes combine three properties that, as far as we know, are never found together in a single system: only protons permeate through the crystal, it is one-atom-thick and it can sustain very strong electrical forces. This combination allows us to essentially pull apart the first layer of water molecules on the graphene surface”.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><category><![CDATA[sciences,Research,Research-Beacons,advanced-materials,graphene,National-Graphene-Institute,science,materials-science,2-dmaterials,2dmaterials,2d-materials,Science and Engineering,headlines]]></category>

But aside from a manufacturer’s word, there isn’t an easy way to verify this.</span></p><p><span>Now, researchers reporting in </span><a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acssuschemeng.2c03389" target="_blank"><i><span>ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering</span></i></a><span> have developed a simple, fraud-resistant technique to evaluate the recycled content of new plastic products. They added a fluorescent tag to plastic resins, successfully tracking the recycled content in products made with a variety of plastics and colours.</span></p><p><span>After reducing and reusing, recycling is the last line of defence for keeping plastic out of landfills or the environment. To encourage plastic recycling, some countries have shifted the responsibility to producers for incorporating these “post-consumer materials” in new products, such as single-use items and packaging. Whereas the U.K. is taxing plastic products with little recycled content, other countries, such as Italy and Spain, plan to impose taxes soon on products that contain no recycled content.</span></p><p><span>However, approaches to verify these amounts aren’t always accurate, potentially leading to fraud and public mistrust. One solution could be to tag recycled plastics with the fluorescent molecule 4,4,-bis(2-benzoxazolyl)stilbene (BBS), and then track the tagged recycled feedstocks into their resulting products. BBS’s fluorescence intensity and colour vary when different levels are present, and it’s inexpensive and approved for food contact applications. So, Michael Shaver and colleagues wanted to see how BBS could be used to measure the recycled content of single-use plastic products.</span></p><p><span>The researchers mixed small amounts of BBS into melted high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and then mixed that with virgin HDPE resin, simulating 0 to 100% recycled content materials.

However, designing economic policies that support advancement across multiple SDGs can be hindered by multi-sector economies and conflicting policies.<br><br>Governments are usually charged with crafting economic policies to achieve sustainable development but face challenges in optimising across sectors - ideally, policymakers and stakeholders would develop economic policies that create synergies and manage trade-offs between different goals.<br><br>To address the challenge of designing balanced, sustainable economic policies, researchers have developed a tool which combines economy-wide sustainability simulation with artificial intelligence-driven multi-objective, multi-SDG policy search and machine learning.<br><br><span>The framework the tool creates can help to develop consensus across often competing economic, social, and environmental government mandates. Using a case study of Egypt, the research shows that integrated policy strategies can help achieve sustainable development while balancing adverse economic, social and political impacts of reforms.</span></p><p><span>“Economy systems are complex with many competing sectors - the proposed artificial intelligence-based approach can help policymakers and stakeholders navigate economic complexities to design balanced policy interventions to progress towards the SDGs,” said Dr Mohammed Basheer, another author of the paper.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

It details how policymakers and academics can use a more creative, participatory approach when working with older people, and introduces a selection of methods that might be used.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>The booklet argues that such an approach can be used to better represent older people’s lives in policy and research - something pivotal to the creation of </span><a href="https://extranet.who.int/agefriendlyworld/age-friendly-cities-framework/"><span>age-friendly cities</span></a><span> – as well as creating a living archive of everyday life that is of significance to policy and interested residents.</span><br><br><span>The project responds to calls from the Greater Manchester Ageing Hub about the need for new, innovative methods with regards to co-production. By showcasing how older age is experienced differently, the project responds to research and campaigns which have identified that representations of older age often fall back on medicalised, stereotypical accounts of what constitutes older lives.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>“There is a risk the catch-all term of ‘older people’, which refers to a diverse group, becomes a catch-all agenda – we should not treat all ‘older people’ and places as the same,” said Dr Barron.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This booklet offers great insight into the diversity of life experience amongst older people and some practical and effective research methods,” said Virginia Tandy, Director of The Creative Ageing Development Agency. “It also highlights the central importance of social connection and agency to ageing well.”</span><br><br><span>Creating Age-Friendly Cities is a key theme under The University of Manchester’s </span><a href="https://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/beacons/global-inequalities"><span>Global Inequalities Research Beacon</span></a><span> and a </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges"><span>Grand Challenge</span></a><span> for the UK Government. The </span><a href="https://www.greatermanchester-ca.gov.uk/what-we-do/equalities/ageing-hub/"><span>Greater Manchester Ageing Hub</span></a><span> is working to make the region age-friendly, and developing a rich understanding of older lives is pivotal to this task.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The students will be awarded a joint degree from both institutions, based on a single research experience managed cooperatively by both institutions.</span></p><p><span>For IISc, India’s leading University for Science and Technology, this represents only their third Joint Doctoral Programme and the first with a European partner. For the University of Manchester, this follows the highly successful launch of similar Dual PhD programmes with the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, University of Toronto, University of Melbourne, and the University of Chile. As a core component of its international strategy, The University of Manchester is entering into a small number of dual award PhD programmes with prestigious partner institutions around the world.</span></p><p><span>“We are delighted to enter into this joint PhD agreement with IISc, the leading science and technology University in India. Graduates from this programme will have the unique advantage of acquiring the best knowledge and skills offered by both these eminent institutions.”, said Professor Dame Nancy Rothwell, President and Vice-chancellor</span></p><p><span>The Director of IISc, Professor Govindan Rangajaran, said “Indian Institute of Science is pleased to partner with The University of Manchester for the joint PhD programme. Given multiple areas of mutual interest to both institutions, we are confident that this will be a very productive partnership that further strengthens our ties.”</span></p><p><span>Professor Stephen Flint said: “The joint PhD programme with IISc is testament to the University’s strategic ambitions to build world-class research links with India and to encourage more student mobility between the two countries.” He further added, “The University of Manchester established research partnerships with IISc some years ago and this PhD programme is the next step in deepening our relationship, with academic colleagues in both institutions sharing supervision of the PhD students, who will spend 2 years in Manchester and 2 years in Bengaluru. This agreement reflects the growing strength of partnership between the UK and India."</span></p><p><span>Academics from the two institutions will liaise to define projects which are approved by a Joint Programme Board. The research Seed Fund will support staff and student exchange, workshops and other modes of engagement to facilitate the establishment of these projects and new collaborations. Initial areas of focus will include Industry 4.0, Advanced Manufacturing, Environmental Science and Advanced Materials.&nbsp; Under this programme, full and partial funding will be available on a competitive basis, and we expect the opportunity to benefit from the expertise and infrastructure of two globally renowned institutions will present an attractive prospect for talented aspiring researchers.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

In the longer-term, life expectancy increased at a faster rate in Greater Manchester than in the rest of the country.</span></li><li><span>Improvements in life expectancy were larger in the local authorities with the worst levels of income deprivation and lowest life expectancy prior to devolution, when compared to areas with equally high deprivation and low life expectancy in the rest of England.</span></li></ul><p><span>The improvements, say the researchers, may have been a result of a combination of changes in response to the devolution deals in the region, including the health and social care devolution agreement, the devolution of powers over wider determinants of health (such as housing, employment, transport, adult education, policing, and economic development), and the election of a Greater Manchester mayor.</span></p><p><span>The study, which is the first of first kind, estimated the impact of devolution on the population stratified by sex, local authority, income deprivation, and life expectancy compared to the rest of England, excluding London.</span></p><p><span>The researchers used local authority data on life expectancy at birth published by the Office for National Statistics between 2006 and 2019 to calculate the relationship.</span></p><p><span>Lead author Dr Philip Britteon Research Fellow at The University of Manchester said: “We provide the first robust evidence on the impact of devolution in England on population health, focusing on changes occurring in Greater Manchester.</span></p><p><span>“The study shows modest improvements in life expectancy in Greater Manchester compared to comparable areas in the rest of the country from the introduction of devolution until the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, using a robust statistical method.</span></p><p><span>“This finding may have been driven by combination of changes in response to the health and social care devolution agreement, the devolution of powers over wider public services, the election of a new mayor, or earlier steps to improve population health prior to devolution.</span></p><p><span>"The findings support the suggestion that devolved systems are able to more closely identify and address the needs of local populations. However, further research is required to understand the mechanisms behind the estimated effect.”</span></p><p><span>Co-author Professor Matt Sutton from The University of Manchester and Deputy Director of the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR) Applied Research Collaboration Greater Manchester (ARC-GM) said: “In Greater Manchester many more people die younger than in most other parts of the UK; many others suffer more from serious diseases.</span></p><p><span>“However, this study has shown that devolution in Greater Manchester could improve things for the better.”</span></p><p>Following devolution, <span>the Greater Manchester Health and Social Care Partnership (GMHSCP) </span>was established to set strategy and oversee its delivery, including the delivery of <i>Taking Charge</i>, the region’s five year plan.</p><p><span>And also part of the health and social care devolution settlement, NHS England granted the region control of its share of the national sustainability and transformation fund.</span></p><p><span>The GMHSCP policy priorities also formed components of </span><i><span>The Greater Manchester Strategy</span></i><span>; a plan produced &nbsp;by Greater Manchester Combined Authority on behalf of Greater Manchester partners, to transform and integrate public services within the conurbation.</span></p><p><span>Co-author Dr Yiu-Shing Lau from The University of Manchester said: “These findings may provide clues to the potential success or failure of Integrated Care Systems in England.</span></p><p><span>“However, there are key differences that should be considered when drawing comparisons between the setup of the GMHSCP and the organisation of Integrated Care Systems outlined in the Health and Care Act 2022.</span></p><p><span>“Similar improvements in population health may not be replicated in Integrated Care Systems without a comprehensive representation of councils on their board.</span></p><p><span>“The success of future devolution reforms may therefore depend on other factors beyond the types and strength of powers devolved to a health system, including the extent to which health and wider public services are aligned.</span></p><p><span>“Future research will seek to further investigate the findings of the study by evaluating the impact of devolution on a range of outcome measures and investigating the activities in Greater Manchester that may have contributed to the observed change in life expectancy”</span></p><p><span>The paper, The Impact of Devolution on Health:&nbsp; A Synthetic Control Analysis of Greater Manchester in England, published in&nbsp; in </span>The Lancet Public Health <span>is published in </span>The Lancet Public Health&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The beds record a key period in the natural history of Britain from Mesolithic to Medieval times (9000 to 1000 years ago).</span><br><br><span>The footprint beds show that, as global sea levels rose rapidly after the last ice age around 9000 to 6000 years ago, humans formed part of rich intertidal ecosystems alongside aurochs, red deer, roe deer, wild boar, and beaver, as well as the predators wolf and lynx. On the other side of Britain, Doggerland was reclaimed by the North Sea in this period.</span><br><br><span>In the agriculture-based societies that followed, human footprints dominate the Neolithic period and later footprint beds, alongside a striking fall in large mammal species richness.</span><br><br><span>The researchers show that the area close to the modern shoreline was a hub of human and animal activity in the first few thousand years after the last glacial period. The vast coastal landscapes of the European Mesolithic were rich ecosystems teeming with large animals. This was a biodiversity hotspot with large grazers and predators – a northwest European Serengeti.</span><br><br><span>The observed decline in large mammals in the footprint record could be the result of several drivers including habitat shrinkage following sea level rise and the development of agricultural economies, as well as hunting pressures from a growing human population. This new record poses important questions of the conventional archaeological and fossil records.</span></p><p><span>“Assessing the threats to habitat and biodiversity posed by rising sea levels is a key research priority for our times – we need to better understand these processes in both the past and the present,” said Professor Jamie Woodward, who is an author of this study. “This research shows how sea level rise can transform coastal landscapes and degrade important ecosystems.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

Graham at The University of Manchester.&nbsp;<br><br>It hopes to raise awareness of clothing deprivation, provide clothing directly to people on the ground through Community Sharewear franchises, bring about a change in the law which better protects the right to clothing, and thus ensure that charity is not required for any individual to access adequate clothing.&nbsp;<br><br>Sharewear UK, a clothing charity based in Nottingham, has been providing clothing to those who are unable to afford them, including vulnerable families and individuals, refugees and those with no recourse to public funds and from its centre in the city since 2014.&nbsp;<br><br>Over the last year, they have partnered with the Peace and Justice Project to set up Community Sharewares - hubs in other cities run by volunteers where people can access clothing free of charge, starting later this year including in Manchester.&nbsp;<br><br>Manchester is an apt location for the launch as the city was a centre for the textile industry, and Lincoln thanked the stance that workers in the city took maintaining an anti-slavery cotton embargo during the American Civil War, which Mr. Corbyn will make reference to at the event.<br><br>A truckload of clothes is burned or dumped in the UK every second, and the campaign’s first action will be to urge activists to write to clothing brands and retailers asking what they currently do with their returns and end of line stock, before actions further in the year around lobbying MPs to support the Right to Clothing.<br><br>The campaign is also building a Right to Clothing Network comprising of foodbanks, charities, trade union branches, campaigns and organisations working in the field of clothing depravation The campaign will also look at two important strands related to the right to clothing: sustainability in fashion and garment-workers rights and is inviting groups working in this field to join their network.</p><p>Louise Cooke, Founder and CEO of Sharewear UK said: “Being unable to afford basic clothing prevents millions of people across the UK from being able to simply function, yet alone flourish, in life. Meanwhile, over 300,000 tonnes of clothing goes to landfill in the UK each year and countless tonnes of clothing are incinerated by fashion retailers. This is a ridiculous situation and, after more than eight years of alleviating clothing poverty, we hope that the Right to Clothing campaign will help to put right this imbalance.”<br><br>Dr Luke Graham, an academic specialising in Human Rights law and destitution said “Whilst other deprivations, notably food deprivations, are highly publicised and visible in the UK public consciousness the same is not true of clothing deprivation.&nbsp; Yet clothing deprivation is a large and still growing issue. To address this issue, it is crucial that we make it visible. Reasserting the ‘forgotten’ right to adequate clothing through the work of this campaign will be a crucial step towards achieving this.”<br><br>For more information about the campaign, visit <a href="http://www.righttoclothing.org">www.righttoclothing.org.</a></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The WHO included autism as a key priority in its Mental Health Action Plan in 2014.</span></p><p><span>About five million families in India live with a young autistic child, the great majority with no access to services. Over a 10-year collaboration, Sangath and The University of Manchester have carefully adapted an autism programme developed for the UK to the South Asian context. The resulting 'Parent-mediated Autism Social Communication Intervention for non-Specialists Plus’ &nbsp;(PASS Plus), delivered by lay-health workers, is the first of its kind and has shown real-world impact in two initial randomised controlled trials, with large-scale evaluation underway in New Delhi.</span></p><p><span>NAMASTE will be a collaboration between the two lead organisations and Autism Care Nepal, the College of Paediatrics Sri Lanka, Harvard Medical School, La Trobe University, Kings College London, the World Health Organisation and Ummeed, Mumbai.</span></p><p><span>Prof Jonathan Green, the Lead Investigator from the University of Manchester said, "I am delighted and proud at the launch of the NIHR Global Health Research Unit NAMASTE. This is the culmination of more than a decade of development work between University of Manchester and South Asia partners, particularly Sangath in India. It is a tremendous award for Global Health Research and Development in Autism; initiating for the first time an evidenced integrated detection and care support pathway adapted to the needs of low resource settings with non-specialist delivery. NAMASTE has the potential to initiate a step-change in the reach and effectiveness of Autism health care in low-resource settings and support ongoing clinical research developments to benefit the whole region and beyond."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Dr. Gauri Divan, co-principle investigator from Sangath stated: “This is the result of over ten years of systematic research in the area of community care for autism which we have been doing in Sangath. We know that families continue to struggle to receive a diagnosis and then to find proven affordable care. We hope to use our experience with working with ASHA workers in Delhi, who have been delivering the PASS Plus intervention in the homes of families. This experience has given us confidence that we can implement this across districts in South Asia by collaborating with existing health care providers and provide examples for scaling up services.</span></p><p><span>Parent advocate Gopika Kapoor, who will be part of the programme shared “ As a parent of a child with autism, living in an urban areas, with access to resources and no financial constraints, I am aware of my privileges, as I am of the fact that my son and I form a minority in the Indian subcontinent. NAMASTE will help families across the subcontinent access evidence based care techniques which will help them support their children to thrive.”</span></p><p><span>Dr Sunita Amatya, Chairperson, AutismCare Nepal Society stated that “NAMASTE is a potential game changer in the arena of developmental disabilities and autism and is an absolute need of the time in Nepal. The need for early detection and intervention services has not yet been identified at a policy level in Nepal, and this program will facilitate this step.”</span></p><p><span>Dr Asiri Hewamalahe, Consultant Community Physician, Ministry of Health, Sri Lanka and Dr Dilini Vipulaguna a community paediatrician, who will together be leading the work in Sri Lanka are clear that</span></p><p><span>"Namaste will complement the existing system of early detection and early interventions for developmental disorders including autism in Sri Lanka. Most importantly, it will fill the gap in caregiver training and parent advocacy which is a timely need for families. During the current context of economic hardships to Sri Lanka 'Namaste' is indeed a blessing".</span></p><p><span>Prof Vikram Patel from Harvard Medical School, is pleased that the work that his team has supported in Sangath involving the use of digital platforms to help non-specialists to learn and then deliver pyscho-social interventions will be incorporated in NAMASTE. “Digital tools offer the most exciting opportunity to rapidly scale up, and assure the quality of, psychosocial interventions for mental health. NAMASTE will be the first program in the world to do so for autism”.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

It is an honour for Manchester to be nominated such a prestigious prize.</p><p><span>In the last two years, the University has saved </span>CO<sub>2 </sub>through active travel, shaped municipal climate change policy, increased biodiversity and enabled ethical consumption whilst empowering and equipping the future workforce of a net zero world. The Earthshot Prize would harness the massive global force for sustainability to affect change whilst shaping the decision makers of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>Action for sustainability requires both multidisciplinary and collaborative solutions. The University methodology transforms how universities contribute to the most urgent challenges facing our planet in a scalable way.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.universitylivinglab.org">University Living Lab</a> connects Manchester students to hundreds of research projects set by organisations around the world working at the cutting edge of sustainable development. Framed with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals these projects can be adapted to most assessments for most disciplines for students across the globe to tackle.</p><p>Dr Julian Skyrme, Director of Social Responsibility said: Our community of over 40,000 students have a range of advanced skills that can benefit communities, but rarely are these harnessed at scale, and in ways that meet the real needs of communities. Our University Living Lab addresses this challenge in of the UK’s largest universities by supporting students to undertake practical pieces of work linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Driven by a multitude of community-driven, people, planet and prosperity challenges students develop their sense of social responsibility, meet key learning objectives and know they are making a difference to real needs.”</p><p><a href="https://www.sustainability.manchester.ac.uk/get-involved/staff/50000actions/">50,000 Actions</a> is the biggest environmental sustainability initiative in the higher education sector. Manchester students and staff are together taking small steps to live more sustainably and take care of our planet at a global level.&nbsp;</p><p>Through this platform, people can pledge sustainability actions and charter their progress. There are more than 150 different actions to reduce carbon impact and combat climate change whilst looking after the environment.</p><p>Dr Jennifer O’Brien, Lecturer in Geography said: “The 43,000 students are the University of Manchester are agents of change for sustainability, yes as future thinkers, decision and policy makers, but also right now during their studies. Our innovative, scalable, methodology through the University Living Lab and 50,000 Actions deploys that huge force for change whilst enhancing student experience and employability.”</p><p>The University’s approach brings up a huge potential. With the estimated growth rate of students in higher education, 50000 small actions could add up to great change. This method brings the full knowledge resources of universities to bear upon the most pressing global challenges, delivering timely, streamlined, replicable and scalable change.</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

In these fields they identify more than 140000 extragalactic systems, including various astrophysical exotica: interacting galaxies, various types of active galactic nuclei, radio galaxies, and several gravitational lens systems.</p><p>Most of these sources are located at cosmological distances, but the inventory also includes several nearby galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters. Although these systems are located many millions of light years away, if the strength of technosignatures follow an approximate power-law distribution (as transmitters here on Earth do), there might be a few rare but very bright signals that are detectable.</p><p>Nearby galaxies, galaxy groups and galaxy clusters are a great place to look for these rare powerful signals, as these systems contain hundreds of billions of stars and many of these will host potentially habitable planets. Since the original Breakthrough Listen surveys did not detect any technosignatures, Garrett & Siemion were able to place constraints on the luminosity function of potential extraterrestrial transmitters and limits on the prevalence of very powerful transmitters associated with the billions of stars comprising these systems have also been determined.&nbsp;</p><p>For some time Garrett has been troubled that previous SETI surveys have not accounted for the fact that a radio telescope’s field of view also includes many distant background objects, in addition to the nearby target star - he believes that “SETI radio surveys place stronger limits on the prevalence of extraterrestrial intelligence in the distant Universe than is often fully appreciated”.&nbsp;</p><p>Siemion notes that, “the Breakthrough Listen programme is also targeting 100 nearby galaxies but in the future we will be specifically observing large concentrations of stars at cosmological distances to further probe for very bright, very rare technosignatures.”&nbsp;</p><p>The paper, “Constraints on extragalactic transmitters via Breakthrough Listen observations of background sources”, has been accepted for publication in <i>Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</i>. A preprint and supplementary material, including figures, are available at <a href="http://seti.berkeley.edu/extragalactic/" target="_blank">seti.berkeley.edu/extragalactic</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The paper was funded by the National Institute for Health and Care Research Greater Manchester Patient Safety Translational Research Centre (NIHR GM PSTRC). The centre is a partnership between The University of Manchester and Northern Care Alliance NHS Foundation Trust. The paper was also funded by the NIHR School for Primary Care Research.</span></p><p><span>Burnout is a reaction to prolonged or chronic work-related stress and involves exhaustion, feelings of not being able to do the job, and cynicism. It is becoming more common among doctors, and this is the largest review&nbsp;to critically assess published studies on the effects of the quality of care given to patients and the engagement of doctors with their career.</span></p><p><span>Dr Alexander Hodkinson, NIHR Senior Fellow at the Centre for Primary Care, and lead for this research at the GM PSTRC, said: “We understand that doctors are under a number of pressures and with burnout taking the form of an epidemic, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s important to understand its impact on the quality of care doctors give. The fact that both general practitioners and hospital doctors with burnout are twice as likely to be involved in a patient safety incident and are three times as likely to leave their job is significant. Therefore, for organisations such as the NHS, addressing burnout needs to be a priority.</span></p><p><span>“Also, understanding how burnout affects a doctor’s engagement with their career is valuable.&nbsp; If doctors aren’t engaged, they’re more likely to leave the profession, leading to an increase in staff turnover which can negatively impact patients and healthcare organisations.”</span></p><p><span>The research involved analysing 170 papers and revealed that doctors experiencing burnout are up to four times more likely to be dissatisfied with their job and more than three times as likely to regret their career choice. In addition, they are twice as likely to receive low satisfaction ratings from patients.</span></p><p><span>Aneez Esmail, Professor of General Practice at The University of Manchester who was involved in this study, said: “The pressures that many clinicians face in the NHS is impacting on their ability to deliver safe and effective care. In relation to general practice, the impact of this stress is causing doctors to experience burnout so they become despondent and think about leaving the profession (either by retiring early or leaving the NHS). This also impacts on how they deliver care to patients, with doctors who experience burnout more likely to make errors that result in patient harm. By addressing burnout, this research helps to show that care could be safer.”</span></p><p><span>*Associations of Burnout with the Career Engagement of Physicians and the Quality of Patient Care: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis – </span><a href="https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2022-070442"><span>https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj-2022-070442</span></a></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

For example, 2019 research found that Greater Manchester’s productivity was 89% of the UK average, falling from 92.2% in 1998.<br><br>The report asks why such disparities exist, and what can be done about them. It includes recommendations on how to level up the country locally, regionally and nationally.<br><br>The launch event included two round tables, led by leading academics in their fields. Professor Richard Jones chaired a session on research and development and its role in levelling up, while Dr Luke Munford led a discussion on the causes and implications of health inequality.</p><p>“<i>On Productivity</i> sets out some potential solutions and I was delighted to be able to speak to colleagues in Rochdale and across Greater Manchester about what we can do to tackle these health inequalities and to give everyone a fair chance.”<br><br>The choice of venue for the launch was appropriate, as Rochdale Borough gears up to play a leading role in Greater Manchester’s levelling up agenda.<br><br>Through initiatives like Atom Valley - the largest and most important growth location in Greater Manchester, focused on advanced manufacturing, machinery and materials - Rochdale aims to turbocharge innovation in the region while providing good jobs and new houses for local residents.<br><br>Councillor John Blundell, Cabinet Member for Economy and Communications at Rochdale Borough Council and RDA Board member, said: “<i>On Productivity</i> is a serious piece of academic research and asks searching questions about regional inequality and concepts around levelling up and rebalancing the economy.<br><br>“It speaks volumes about Rochdale’s progress and its commitment to sustainable economic development - through projects like Atom Valley - that The University of Manchester chose to launch such an important report in the Borough.”<br><br>The event was organised by <a href="https://www.policy.manchester.ac.uk/">Policy@Manchester</a> - part of The University of Manchester - supported by the <a href="https://www.cape.ac.uk/">Capabilities in Academic Policy Engagement project</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

With a PhD in Creative Writing from The University of Manchester, David has been writing and self-publishing for over fifteen years.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>David has written single stories and pieces for various magazines and anthologies, and has written four of his own collections of short stories. In the last two years alone, David has been shortlisted for the </span><a href="https://bridportprize.org.uk/the-competition/"><span>Bridport Prize</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://oxfordflashfictionprize.com/"><span>Oxford Flash Fiction Prize</span></a><span> in 2020, and his recent publication ‘</span><a href="https://www.flyonthewallpress.co.uk/product-page/fauna-by-dr-david-hartley"><span>Fauna</span></a><span>’ from </span><a href="https://www.flyonthewallpress.co.uk/"><span>Fly on the Wall Press</span></a><span>, was shortlisted in the Best Short Story Collection category of the </span><a href="https://www.saboteurawards.org/"><span>Saboteur Awards</span></a><span> and longlisted for the </span><a href="https://www.edgehill.ac.uk/news/edge-hill-prize-2022-longlist-announced-including-first-posthumous-collection/"><span>Edge Hill Short Story Prize</span></a><span> this year.</span><br><br><span>David hopes to use his Tartu residency to expand ideas he has been considering recently, such as that of Fauna which he says "drew on my concerns for animal ethics in the contemporary moment as we reckon with our status as human animals in a threatened and precarious ecosystem. I’d love to expand this thinking further to explore how reconceiving humans as animals helps us to confront the dystopia of the climate crisis.”</span><br><br><span>David characterises his writing as ‘weird fiction’, incorporating various aspects of speculative fiction rather than limiting work to a specific genre. His work typically addresses themes around mythmaking, hauntology, neurodiversity, and veganism.</span><br><br><span>David co-hosts the </span><a href="https://www.autism-through-cinema.org.uk/atcpodcast"><span>Autism Through Cinema Podcast</span></a><span>, and is the Cofounder of the ‘</span><a href="https://twitter.com/neuronarratives?lang=en"><span>Narratives of Neurodiversity Network</span></a><span>’.</span><br><br><span>Tartu in Estonia is a UNESCO City of Literature and has been named the </span><a href="https://tartu2024.ee/"><span>European Capital of Culture 2024</span></a><span>. They have decided to use a single writer’s residency to build a piece of work to mark the year.</span><br><br><span>The theme of this residency is ‘Bring Your Own Utopia’ and will see David Hartley paired with Estonian artist </span><a href="https://henrihytt.wordpress.com/category/personal-information/"><span>Henri Hütt.</span></a><span> They will work together during David’s residency in Tartu and collaborate once David has returned to Manchester. David will then return to Tartu in 2024 to exhibit the collaborative work as part of the Capital of Culture programme and 2024 </span><a href="https://kirjandusfestival.tartu.ee/"><span>Prima Vista International Literary Festival</span></a><span> ‘Futures Better and Worse’.</span><br><br><span>David and Henri are in the very early stages of their work already, but they want to start by spending time together in Tartu talking to local people to form the basis of what they create.</span></p><p><span>“David is a brilliantly inventive writer and performer, someone as at home in this world as in the alternate realities he so capably conjures in his fiction,” said Professor John McAuliffe of The University of Manchester's Centre for New Writing. “It is an exciting prospect to imagine how he will develop this new multidisciplinary project in Tartu, and what wild new creature will emerge from UNESCO's support for international Creative City collaborations.”</span><br><br><span>“It’s excellent news that David Hartley has been chosen as the Writer in Residence for Tartu’s 2024 European Capital of Culture celebrations," said &nbsp;Ivan Wadeson, Executive Director of Manchester City of Literature. "It’s further accolade for David on top of an already impressive list, but David’s selection also acts as an international spotlight of the interesting and unique contemporary talent in Manchester.”&nbsp;</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

Its acidity and low water availability also contribute to honey’s healing properties.</span></p><p><span>Its stickiness also provides an effective hydrated barrier between the wound site and external environment.</span></p><p><span>A variety of wound types, the researchers report, have been treated with honey, such as burns, trauma, and chronic wounds.</span></p><p><span>Mesitran, one of the first line of products to incorporate medical grade honey in the UK, was launched in 2005 in Manchester. Over the years other companies followed, as is the application method.</span></p><p><span>In recent years, research has focused on using honey in tissue engineering applications.</span></p><p><span>Things like electrospun nanofibres, hydrogels and cryogels, foams, films, powders, cements, and bioinks have been utilised to fabricate honey-based scaffolds.</span></p><p><span>And some studies have shown how antibiotic-resistant bacteria can be more susceptible to antibiotics when used in tandem with honey.</span></p><p><span>In one paper they cite, when Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was exposed to manuka honey in combination with oxacillin, they acted together to desensitise the MRSA to the antibiotic.</span></p><p><span>Honey’s antimicrobial activity also includes the ability to kill or slow the spread of fungi and viruses.</span></p><p><span>Honey, though, used in combination with traditional wound dressings presents some limitations, such as being absorbed by the dressing, poor penetration into the wound site, and short-term antimicrobial action.</span></p><p><span>However, manufacturers of impregnated dressings are attempting to improve their delivery mechanism to improve the efficacy of the substance.</span></p><p><span>Lead scientist Joel Yupanqui Mieles a postgraduate researcher from The University of Manchester said: “Honey has exciting antimicrobial properties and has been used in traditional medicine to treat wounds since ancient times.</span></p><p><span>“The ancient Egyptians utilised it to treat wounds and there are direct references to honey consumption in the Bible and the Quran.</span></p><p><span>“The compounds in honey offer a bank of potential antimicrobial and regenerative agents that can be utilised to combat antibiotic resistance and aid in tissue healing.</span></p><p><span>“But though the repository of compounds within honey may have immense medical benefit, further research is required to understand more about how they work and how they can be delivered to wounds effectively and safely in a standardised way.</span></p><p><span>He added: “Knowing the type and composition of honey used in different wound types will also improve the quality of research.</span></p><p><span>“That will allow scientists to make the most of honey’s antimicrobial and healing mechanisms</span></p><p><span>“It might even allow us to artificially replicate these in honey-inspired biomaterials that can be exploited with the current advances in tissue engineering technologies.</span></p><p><span>“That would minimise risks around processing in terms sterilisation, storage, transport and determining authenticity and safety.</span></p><p><span>“One thing is certain: rising global antibiotic resistance is stimulating the development of novel therapies as alternatives to combat infections – and honey, we think, has a role to play in that.</span></p><p><span>”People who are worried about a wound should not treat themselves with honey without speaking to a medical profession first.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

Prior to her role in AstraZeneca, Professor Hamerlik was Group Leader for the Brain Tumour Biology laboratory within the Danish Cancer Research Centre with an affiliation as an associate professor at the University of Copenhagen.</span></p><p><span>Bringing her expertise in neuro-oncology, Professor Hamerlik will build a programme focussed on the development of pre-clinical patient-derived xenograft models and capabilities to inform on central nervous system (CNS) tumour biology and the discovery of novel targets for drug and immunotherapy treatment.</span></p><p><span>The newly-created Chair role has been made possible thanks to a grant worth around £1.35 million from The Brain Tumour Charity – the largest dedicated funder of research into the disease globally.</span></p><p style="margin-left:0cm;"><span>Speaking about her appointment, Professor Petra Hamerlik said: “I am very excited about this unique opportunity and hope to leverage both my academic and industrial experience to synergise with an outstanding network of scientific and clinical researchers in Manchester. My ambition is to build a platform of evidence which would serve as a stepping stone to redefining the care and thereby improving the outcome of patients suffering from this deadly disease."</span></p><p><span>In the UK, on average more than 12,000 people are diagnosed with a brain or other CNS or intracranial tumour every year. Five-year survival for individuals is also low, with only 12% surviving the disease, underpinning the need for further research and treatments.*</span></p><p><span>Professor Rob Bristow, Director of the MCRC, which is a partnership formed in 2006 by The University of Manchester, Cancer Research UK and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust said: “I am thrilled that Professor Hamerlik is joining our cancer research ecosystem and catalysing brain cancer research in Manchester. The new models and biomarker approaches that she brings for the detection and treatment of this devastating tumour will not doubt place Manchester as one of the leading research programmes in translational CNS research.”</span></p><p><span>Neuro-oncology is a growing area of research in Manchester. In 2021, the GJBRC was established with specific themes to accelerate neuro-oncology. In the same year, The Christie and Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust (now Northern Care Alliance) were named as a Tessa Jowell Centre of Excellence. Professor Hamerlik will work to leverage the teams and infrastructure across Manchester with the ultimate aim of identifying new treatments for patients with brain tumours.</span></p><p><span>Professor Stuart Allan, Co-Director of the GJBRC, said “Petra’s appointment comes at a very exciting time for translational neuroscience research in Manchester with the launch last year of the GJBRC. The ambition of the GJBRC is to improve the lives of patients affected by neurological disease, with brain tumours a primary focus. Attracting Petra to Manchester is an important step in realising this ambition’”.</span></p><p><span>Professor Graham Lord, Vice-President and Dean of the Faculty of Biology , Medicine and Health at The University of Manchester, said: “We are delighted to welcome Professor Petra Hamerlik, one of the world’s leading experts in neuro-oncology, to The University of Manchester. The low survival rates for people who have brain cancer emphasises the need for further research and treatment to combat this devastating disease. Professor Hamerlik’s world renowned expertise in this area will be a great asset to our work at Manchester which aims to bring us closer to doing just that.”</span></p><p><span>Dr David Jenkinson, Chief Scientific Officer at The Brain Tumour Charity, which funds world-class research and trusted support and information services, said: “We are incredibly excited that Professor Petra Hamerlik has been appointed as the inaugural The Brain Tumour Charity Chair of Neuro-Oncology, which will be a major boost to brain tumour research here in the UK.</span></p><p><span>“With over 5,400 people still losing their lives to this devastating disease every year in the UK, we urgently need to accelerate progress towards new and kinder treatment options. Professor Hamerlik’s appointment will be critical to establishing a world-leading research centre in Manchester, helping attract the brightest minds to the field in this country and maximising opportunities to collaborate to help us find new therapies faster.</span></p><p><span>“Thanks to the amazing generosity of our supporters, we’re immensely proud to be able to invest £1.35m to support this transformational role for the next five years. With such a strong track-record in translating breakthroughs from the lab bench through to improved care in NHS hospitals, Manchester represents a really unique research environment to catalyse much-needed progress for thousands of families affected by brain tumours – and we’re delighted that Petra has joined to lead and drive this work forward. A cure can’t wait.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The university is providing academic support and training as well as sharing teaching and learning materials, and hopes to start providing elective clinical placements here in Manchester for their most senior students - the aim is to stabilise the pipeline of desperately-needed newly qualified doctors in the war-torn country.</span></p><p><span>These long-term twinning partnerships will provide vital support in the short term, so students can continue their studies, and researchers can carry on with their research. In the longer term, this collaboration will help the Ivan Horbachevsky Ternopil National Medical University to rebuild their campus and play an important role in the rebuilding of Ukraine.</span><br><br><span>“When the opportunity to support a fellow medical school came along via the UUK twinning scheme, we were keen to help,” said Professor Margaret Kingston, Director of Undergraduate Medical Studies at The University of Manchester. “It has meant an awful lot to colleagues in Ternopil to receive our support, as their main concern was losing their faculty and students.”</span><br><br><span>“They have lost many students and staff as people have left the country or joined the fighting, funds have been diverted and accommodation is housing displaced persons. Their request to us was to help them to continue delivering medical training so their supply of future doctors is maintained, and they do not suffer an even worse “brain drain” in addition to everything else.”</span><br><br><span>The university is also supporting Ukraine in other ways. In June, the University and the Ukrainian Student Society worked together to organise participation in a live question and answer session with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in which he thanked universities for their support and spoke of the deep historic links Ukraine has with British academia. There was such high demand for tickets that a second location had to be secured at extremely short notice to broadcast the session to students.</span></p><p><span>A team of volunteer medics from UK-Med - a charity based at the university which provides healthcare assistance during humanitarian crises around the world – is currently working across Ukraine to provide care for the many people in need. The charity is also providing support and training for local healthcare staff, who are having to respond to situations far beyond anything they’ve ever dealt with before.</span><br><br><span>Soon after UK-Med launched their </span><a href="https://www.uk-med.org/ukraine"><span>Ukraine Appeal</span></a><span>, Joe Stafford from the university’s news and media relations team embarked on a marathon cycle ride in The Netherlands, Germany and Belgium to raise funds for the charity. He was able to raise over £3000 by riding 1600km in 14 days, as well as raising the profile of UK-Med by appearing in the media both here in the UK and in The Netherlands.&nbsp;</span><br><br><span>An expert from the university is also helping Ukrainians by repurposing her research activities to create a system which provides a running account of atrocities taking place in the country. Working with colleagues in the USA, Dr Olga Onuch established the </span><a href="https://mlp.trinity.duke.edu/dataforukraine.php#en"><span>Data for Ukraine</span></a><span> project which analyses Twitter data using machine-learning algorithms to highlight humanitarian needs, displaced people, civilian resistance and human rights violations. This is helping aid agencies to direct their resources, as well as permanently documenting abuses and atrocities in order for justice to be sought after the war ends.</span></p><p><span>Vivienne Stern MBE, Chief Executive, Universities UK said: “I’m really proud of the way that the UK university sector has stepped up to play its part in the global response to enabling Ukrainian universities to get through this war and hopefully emerge stronger.</span><br><br><span>For more information about the campaign, visit </span><a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/twinforhope"><span>www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/twinforhope</span></a><span>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></span><br><br>&nbsp;</p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

The method developed involves paper spray ionisation mass spectrometry combined with ion mobility separation and can be performed in as little as 3 mins from swab to results. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Professor Perdita Barran at The University of Manchester, who led the research said: “We are tremendously excited by these results which take us closer to making a diagnostic test for Parkinson's Disease that could be used in clinic.”</span></p><p><span>The research used a sample group of 79 people with Parkinson’s compared with a heathy control group of 71 people.</span></p><p><span>The study has arisen from the observation of Joy Milne, who discovered that she can distinguish PD in individuals from a distinct body odour before clinical symptoms occur.</span></p><p><span>Joy has hereditary Hyperosmia – a heightened sensitivity to smells – which has been exploited to find that Parkinson’s has a distinct odour which is strongest where sebum collects on patient’s backs and is less often washed away.</span></p><p><span>Sebum is an oily secretion from sebaceous glands under the skin which are connected to the endocrine system. The scientists have found that sebum can be used as a diagnostic biofluid, which is rich in hydrophobic endogenous metabolites.</span></p><p><span>Altered sebum production is a well-recognised feature of Parkinson’s. The sampling procedure they have developed is simple and non-invasive; sebum is collected in clinics from the upper back of patients and posted in the regular mail to the lab.</span></p><p><span>Describing the new technique Dr Depanjan Sarkar said: “The sebum is transferred to filter paper from sampling swab, and we then cut this to a triangle, add a drop of solvent, apply a voltage and this transfers compounds from the sebum into the mass spectrometer. When we do this, we find more than 4000 unique compounds of which 500 are different between people with PD compared to the control participants.”</span></p><p><span>The Manchester team now see this as a major step forward towards a clinical method for confirmatory diagnosis of Parkinson’s, for which to date there is no diagnostic test based on biomarkers.</span></p><p><span>Professor Monty Silverdale, Clinical Lead on this study said: "This test has the potential to massively improve the diagnosis and management of people with Parkinson’s disease".</span></p><p><span>The current and future focus is to translate these findings into a test of clinical utility. This exciting new work also opens the door to possibly diagnosing other diseases through non-invasive sebum analysis and the team along with the University of Manchester have launched a spin out company Sebomix Ltd. to develop this further.</span></p><p><span>The charities </span><a href="https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/" target="_blank"><span>Parkinson’s UK</span></a><span> and the </span><a href="https://www.michaeljfox.org/" target="_blank"><span>Michael J.

It also revealed how different combinations of restoration work has made a significant impact in slowing water flow from the moors to the valleys, to help mitigate flooding[1].</span></p><p><span>Craig added: “Kinder has a rich history and was the backdrop to one of the mass trespass activities 90 years ago which led to open access to moorland and the creation of National Parks paving the way for millions of visitors to be able to escape city living and pollution to enjoy some of our most inspiring landscapes and connect with nature.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Commenting on the new declaration, Oliver Harmar, Chief Operating Officer at National England said: “National Nature Reserves were established to protect some of our most important habitats, species and geology, to provide 'outdoor laboratories’ for environmental science and opportunities for people to enjoy nature.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“They are at the heart of our ambition to create a Nature Recovery Network, full of wildlife-rich sites that are bigger, better and more connected.&nbsp; I’m pleased that this vision is very much alive at Kinder Scout, with the expansion demonstrating the power of collaborative action to drive nature recovery, including vital peatland restoration to capture and store carbon.</span></p><p><span>“Kinder Scout also holds a special place in our national history as the backdrop to the very creation of our National Parks and National Nature Reserves.&nbsp; Today, NNRs, like Kinder Scout, are great places to be inspired and get hands on with nature – they’re free, open and available to all.”</span></p><p><span>[1] The monitoring work on the Kinder Scout plateau undertaken by Moors for the Future Partnership and the University of Manchester represents a decade of data that has proved invaluable in understanding natural flood management (NFM) techniques. Since 2016, this monitoring has been financed under the EU Life-funded MoorLIFE 2020 project and has shown that:</span></p><p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Revegetation of bare peat led to a 98% reduction in erosion of peat into the streams, within 18 months.</span></p><p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of revegetation, gully blocking and dense sphagnum planting led to a 65% reduction in peak flow (the time it takes for water to reach the valleys) during storm events, 10 years after initial revegetation (and five years after sphagnum planting).</span></p><p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A combination of revegetation and dense sphagnum planting led to a 2 hours 40 minutes delay in delivery of peak flow during storm events. These NFM benefits increases in bigger storms.</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>

This is a huge change. For centuries, “illegitimacy” and unmarried parenthood has been associated with stigma, shame and disadvantage.<br><br>The civil registration of births only began in 1845, but we have parish register data that goes back to the 16th century. Although it fluctuated, the “illegitimacy ratio” – the proportion of births marked as to unmarried parents in parish registers – <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00324728.1973.10405709?_ga=2.140913586.1602688024.1660898575-1678099319.1660898575&_gl=1*owo8ld*_ga*MTY3ODA5OTMxOS4xNjYwODk4NTc1*_ga_0HYE8YG0M6*MTY2MDg5ODU3NS4xLjEuMTY2MDg5ODU4OS4wLjAuMA">never passed 7% of the total</a> from the 16th century until the 1960s. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandlifeexpectancies/articles/youdrawthecharts60yearsofchange/2017-10-24">Since then</a>, however, the proportion has climbed steadily.</p><p>This increase shows not only that more babies are being born to parents who are not married, but that fewer parents are hiding the circumstances of their children’s birth. The illegitimacy ratio represents only those children whose birth to unmarried parents was noticed by the state, so the real number would have been much higher.</p><p><img class="image_resized" style="width:800px;" src="https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=237&fit=clip" alt="Black and white image of portrait of a man in uniform" srcset="https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=600&h=753&fit=crop&dpr=1 600w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=30&auto=format&w=600&h=753&fit=crop&dpr=2 1200w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=15&auto=format&w=600&h=753&fit=crop&dpr=3 1800w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=45&auto=format&w=754&h=946&fit=crop&dpr=1 754w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=30&auto=format&w=754&h=946&fit=crop&dpr=2 1508w, https://images.theconversation.com/files/480785/original/file-20220824-12-l86cnx.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&q=15&auto=format&w=754&h=946&fit=crop&dpr=3 2262w" sizes="100vw"><span class="caption">George Fitzclarence was the son of King William IV and the actress Dorothy Jordan. Because he was illegitimate, the throne went to his cousin, Queen Victoria.</span> <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_FitzClarence,_1._Earl_of_Munster.jpg"><span class="attribution">Richard Austin Artlett (1807-1873), via Wikimedia Commons</span></a></p><p>Many parents altered birth dates, used false names or <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/illegitimacy-family-and-stigma-in-england-1660-1834-9780192867247?cc=gb&lang=en&">pretended to be married</a> to prevent the stigma of illegitimacy being attached to their children’s birth record for life.</p><p>People born to parents who were not married to each other have been legally discriminated against in many cultures across the world for centuries. In England and Wales, laws to deter and punish illegitimacy existed <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/royal-bastards-9780198785828?cc=gb&lang=en&">from at least the early medieval period</a>.</p><p>This reflected Christian beliefs that sex outside marriage was sinful. It was combined with the need to ensure political and economic stability in a society where property, status and identity was based on inheritance from father to child.</p><h2>Facing stigma</h2><p><br>Biological paternity could not be proven in a time before DNA testing, so the theory was that marriage gave men security that a child was theirs. Without marriage, paternity rested on a woman’s word, which was considered dubious in a society that <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/vernacular-bodies-9780199202706?cc=gb&lang=en&">feared female sexual power</a>.</p><p>Due to these fears, there was very little demand for reform. It was <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1987/42/enacted">only in 1987</a> that the legal distinction between legitimate and illegitimate was finally eradicated.</p><p>There were small reforms improving the legal rights of children born to unmarried parents <a href="https://communities.lawsociety.org.uk/private-client-news/library-faq-illegitimate-issue/5067088.article">from 1926 onwards</a>, but their position was always worse than that of a child whose parents were married. An illegitimate child born before 1987 was judged to <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/lawcom-prod-storage-11jsxou24uy7q/uploads/2016/07/LC.-118-FAMILY-LAW-ILLEGITIMACY.pdf">have no legal father</a>, which affected their rights to inherit property.</p><p>In the centuries before the welfare state, children’s entitlement to state support was contested. In a society largely set up for households supported by a male breadwinner or a dual income, children born to unmarried parents were more likely to grow up poor.</p><p><a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/illegitimacy-family-and-stigma-in-england-1660-1834-9780192867247?cc=gb&lang=en&">My research</a> shows that these children in the 18th century were more likely to be separated from their parents and moved between different foster households while they were growing up, and more likely to feel excluded from their communities.</p><p>This stigma did not improve into the 20th century. Historians have found that well into the 1970s, illegitimacy was seen as <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/Family_Secrets/_AKDDQAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0">deeply shameful</a>. Families often hid the circumstances of their children’s birth out of fear that they would be bullied as “bastards”. The impact of this secrecy had long-term effects on children’s identity and self-esteem.</p><p>Unmarried mothers continued to find it difficult to get work and maintenance payments for their children throughout the 20th century. Before 1977, for example, unmarried mothers and their children were usually <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09612025.2011.536383?tab=permissions">excluded from council housing lists</a>. This sent a strong message that unmarried parents should be blamed and penalised for their supposed bad decisions.</p><p>However, the story is not one of unrelenting disadvantage. Many parents and their children <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09612025.2011.536383?tab=permissions">were helped</a> by their families and neighbours, and many children grew up in loving homes. It is hard to escape, though, the fact that any support always took place against the backdrop of legal hostility towards their children’s very existence. They lived within a system that continually argued that unmarried families were inferior.</p><p>It is amazing, then, that in just 35 years, England and Wales have gone from legal stigma to almost complete acceptance of equality between children born to parents who are married and those who are not.</p><h2>Foundations of change</h2><p><br>Reforms in the divorce law and the decriminalisation of same-sex relationships have steadily eroded the idea that political and economic stability depends on the traditional model of the heterosexual married couple and their children. The development of reliable, affordable DNA paternity tests means that the central social rationale behind illegitimacy discrimination – the impossibility of proving paternity – has now disappeared.</p><p>Changes in the opportunities available to women have also considerably mitigated the impact of single motherhood. Women are able to earn more now than at any point in the past. Access to contraception and abortion means that couples now have much more control over when they become parents.</p><p>This progress is uneven, though. Many countries around the world still <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-61928898">seek to regulate</a> female sexuality and reproduction, and religious or conservative organisations continue to argue that marriage is the central foundation of society.</p><p>The history of illegitimacy shows that cultural and legal change is possible. But sexual and reproductive freedom is only a relatively recent phenomenon, and more work is needed to combat the legacy of centuries of discrimination.<img style="border-style:none;margin:0 !important;padding:0 !important;" src="https://counter.theconversation.com/content/189025/count.gif?distributor=republish-lightbox-basic" alt="The Conversation" width="1" height="1"></p><p><a href="https://theconversation.com/profiles/kate-gibson-1371405"><i><span>Kate Gibson</span></i></a><i><span>, Leverhulme Early Career Fellow in History, </span></i><a href="https://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-manchester-1204"><em><i><span>University of Manchester</span></i></em></a></p><p><i>This article is republished from </i><a href="https://theconversation.com"><i>The Conversation</i></a><i> under a Creative Commons license.

Most small SCLC patients, representing 10-15% of all lung cancer cases, are diagnosed late with advanced metastatic disease and few survive beyond 1 to 2 years.&nbsp; However, of the minority of patients with SCLC who are diagnosed very early and have surgery, 6 out of 10 can live for 5 years or more.</span></p><p><span>The research team developed a new method to analyse blood samples and pick up specific DNA modifications called methylation that change early on in the growth of cancers. The team also developed a sophisticated computational method to assess which methylation modifications were present.</span></p><p><span>They focussed on making their method sensitive enough to find methylation modifications in the very low levels of DNA shed from a patient’s tumour into the blood stream, known as called circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA). &nbsp;The test was sufficiently sensitive and accurate to detect methylation of ctDNA, even from patients whose tumours were diagnosed at the earliest stage.</span></p><p><span>The standard treatment for SCLC is chemotherapy, but there are multiple types of SCLC that, recent studies suggest, would respond differently to a range of therapies. The new blood test developed by the team could also classify which type of SCLC is affecting a patient, supporting the potential for more personalised treatment options.</span></p><p><span>Professor Caroline Dive who led the study, which was </span>funded by <span>which was funded by the USA National Cancer Institute (NCI) &nbsp;and&nbsp;</span> Cancer Research UK,<span> said: “SCLC is a terrible disease, causing so much anguish to patients and their families. We think this blood test could be really useful in future clinical trials of new therapies to predict and monitor treatment responses”.</span></p><p><span>Dr Dominic Rothwell, who led the laboratory work said “A key advantage of blood-based molecular subtyping is that blood is much easier to collect and is able to circumvent the challenges often encountered in analysing scant and often extensively necrotic tissue associated with tumour biopsies. Our study opens up the exciting possibility of detecting SCLC earlier and assigning patients to more personalised treatments.”</span></p><p><span>Prof Charles Rudin, Chief of Thoracic Oncology at Memorial Sloane Kettering Cancer Center who leads the global consortium that defined the different types of SCLC said, “To our knowledge, this is the first published study to show that DNA methylation analysis of a blood sample can identify the SCLC molecular subtypes. Though further validation is clearly now needed in a larger independent patient cohort, this blood test could one day assist clinicians in choosing better treatments for SCLC, which is currently notoriously difficult to manage.”</span></p><p><span>Dr Marianne Baker, Research Information Manager at Cancer Research UK said: “These promising early results show that the CRUK Cancer Biomarker Centre is leading the way in developing liquid biopsies. These could allow doctors to spot a person’s lung cancer earlier, and even track how a cancer changes over time, helping them to choose the best treatments.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Many people with small cell lung cancer are diagnosed too late to be eligible for surgery, and this reduces their chances of survival. We urgently need ways to detect it earlier and blood tests like this have the potential to help us achieve this goal.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While more research is needed to be sure these tests will work in practice, it’s exciting to see them moving closer to clinical trials and to helping people with SCLC.”</span></p>]]></content:encoded><pp:quotes>
